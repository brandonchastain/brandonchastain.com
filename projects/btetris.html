<h1>B TETRIS</h1>

<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://tetris.brandonchastain.com/">Play the game here</a>
</p>
<p>
  Swipe the touch screen or use arrow keys to move and rotate the piece.
  Complete a full row to clear it. Beware, the game gets faster each time you do that.
  If your stacked pieces reach the top of the screen, you lose!
</p>

<h4>Controls</h4>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Move the piece</td><td>Left/Right swipe or arrow keys</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Rotate</td><td>Up swipe or arrow key</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Slam the piece down</td><td>Down swipe or arrow key</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Bank the piece</td><td>Tap or click the Bank button</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h2>Developer Log</h2>
<p>
  While making my previous game <a href="bsnake.html">B SNAKE</a>, I learned how fun and addicting it is to build games with C# and Blazor.
  WebAssembly (WASM) is ultra-convenient for me as a dev and for players. I get to program in the same language I use at work every day, 
  and players can play a game on their phone or PC without installing anything.
</p>
<p>
  After I completed B SNAKE, I realized I had a useful template for future games and that I had
  already gotten through the "absolute noob" stage of my gamedev journey.
  So, I used it to make more games!
</p>

<h3>Resurrecting my old Tetris game</h3>
<p>
  I actually already built a Tetris clone in C# some years ago, but it ran in the console
  and was rendered terribly by my custom <code>ConsoleTetrisRenderer</code> class. 
</p>
<img src="../../img/oldTetris.jpg">
<p>
  It became clear to me that
  I could massively revamp the game's graphics and playability by adapting it to my new
  Blazor game template. Once the scaffolding was set up, all I'd need to do is create a new renderer
  implementation that draws to the Blazor HTML5 Canvas. And so I did that!
  I fixed some bugs with piece rotations and added a button to bank the current piece.
</p>
  
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  This project was a blast because of how easy it was - all I did was pop in an old library
  to this project, add a class, adjust a few things - and I had an ACTUAL Tetris game, with graphics, 
  within a few hours. This showed me that re-using code can pay dividends when you want to focus on the
  next exciting challenge.
