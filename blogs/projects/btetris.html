<h2>Porting a console-based Tetris game to the browser (with Blazor)</h2>
<p>
  While making my previous game <a href="bsnake.html">B SNAKE</a>, I learned how fun and addicting it is to build games with C# and Blazor.
  WebAssembly (WASM) is ultra-convenient for me as a dev and for players. I get to program in the same language I use at work every day, 
  and players can play a game on their phone or PC without installing anything.
</p>
<p>
  After I completed B SNAKE, I realized I had a useful template for future games and that I had
  already gotten through the "absolute noob" stage of my gamedev journey.
  So, I used it to make more games!
</p>

<h3>Revive (or, rerender)</h3>
<p>
  I actually already built a Tetris clone in C# some years ago, but it ran in the console
  and was rendered terribly by my custom <code>ConsoleTetrisRenderer</code> class.

<p>
  It became clear to me that
  I could massively revamp the game's graphics and playability by adapting it to my new
  Blazor game template. Once the scaffolding was set up, all I'd need to do is create a new renderer
  implementation that draws to the Blazor HTML5 Canvas. And so I did that!
  I fixed some bugs with piece rotations and added a button to bank the current piece.
</p>
  
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  I'm happy that my old code was implemented well, as I only needed to add a new renderer 
  and wire up some plumbing to get the game working in Blazor.
  
  I also saved some time there because I started with my previous Blazor game as a starter template for this project.
  
  It was really fun to breathe life into an old game I made about 4 years ago.
