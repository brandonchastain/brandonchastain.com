<h2>Porting a console-based Tetris game to the browser (with Blazor)</h2>
<p>
  While making my previous game <a href="bsnake.html">B SNAKE</a>, I learned how fun and addicting it is to build games with C# and Blazor.
  WebAssembly (WASM) is ultra-convenient for me as a dev and for players. I get to program in the same language I use at work every day, 
  and players can play a game on their phone or PC without installing anything.
</p>
<p>
  After completing that project, I had a starter template for any basic 2D game. So, I used it to make another game playable in the browser.
</p>

<h3>Revive (or, rerender)</h3>
<p>
  Years ago, I built a Tetris clone in C#. The core logic worked, but it was ugly. The main problem is it was running via the command-line,
  rendered in the console by my custom <code>ConsoleTetrisRenderer</code> class. See the results yourself.

<p>
    Talk about a glow-up. This is how it looked when I developed the core game (back in 2020). Porting it over to Blazor was a game changer.
</p>
<p>
  After completing the B SNAKE project, it became clear to me that
  I could massively revamp this game's graphics and playability by adapting it to my new
  Blazor game template. Once the scaffolding was set up, all I'd need to do is create a new renderer
  implementation that draws to the Blazor HTML5 Canvas. And so I did that!
  I fixed some bugs with piece rotations and added a button to bank the current piece.
</p>
  
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  I'm happy that I could improve the game's cosmetics and extend its availability to the browser by adding a new renderer.
  and wiring up the plumbing to get Blazor to drive the game loop.
  
  I also saved some time there because I started with my previous Blazor game as a starter template for this project.
  
  It was really fun to breathe life into an old game I made about 4 years ago.
